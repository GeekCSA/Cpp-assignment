This project is implemented software that accept input file containing NxN sized board that can containe only 'X', 'O' and '.' For example:

.X..

..XO

..OX

.O..

This board is written in a .txt file.

The compiled file of the program receives this .txt file as input by the following command:

.\software < example.txt

Then the software creates as an output image that represents the board from the input. (For instance, you can see board.ppm)
