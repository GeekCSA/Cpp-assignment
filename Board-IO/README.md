This project is implemented software that accept input file containing NxN sized board that can containe only 'X', 'O' and '.' For example:
\n
.X.\n
..XO\n
..OX\n
.O ..\n
This board is written in a .txt file.

The compiled file of the program receives this .txt file as input by the following command:

a <example.txt /.

Then the software creates as an output image that represents the board from the input. (For instance, you can see board.ppm)
