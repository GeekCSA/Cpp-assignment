### The Tic-tac-toe game

Tic-tac-toe is a social game where there are two players playing on one board.

## game rules
Each player has a unique shape.
The doctrines work in turns.
Each player is allowed to put his own shape in turn only in an empty slot, meaning that they have not written in previous titles already.
In case someone performs an action prohibited by the rules, the opponent wins automatically.

## the Purpose of the game
The player's goal is to get his form in sequence on the board (from one end to the other) without the second player's form breaking his sequence.
